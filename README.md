# HTML-Portfolio-Practice
This is the first version of an HTML portfolio made based on Dr. Angela Yu's course ("Become a Full-Stack Web Developer with just ONE course", on partnership with AppBrewery on Udemy). It's currently written only in HTML, but, with newer commits are added, CSS and JavaScript should be added to it. First version posted on the 11th of March, 2025.
